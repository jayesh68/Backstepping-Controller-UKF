# Implementation of a Backstepping Controller with Unscented Kalman Filter on a Mobile Robot

1. The pdf of the paper which served as an inspiration for the project titled "" is attached
2. The objectives as part of this project are to ensure that a mobile robot does not change its direction as it travels along a straight path by combining a bioinspired backstepping controller and a torque controller. 
3. A Kalman filter and an Unscented Kalman filter is used to ensure that the desired position is close to the estimated position. The stability is ensured by the Lyapunov stability analysis. 
4. The report covers details of the Mobile Robotâ€™s Kinematics and Dynamics, computation of the estimated state, Kalman Gain and Error covariance of the Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter, deriving the velocities and torque parameters of the backstepping and torque controller followed by an overview of the Lyapunov stability analysis. 
5. The block diagram of the tracking algorithm has been setup in Simulink with simulations generated for a mobile robot travelling in a straight path.
